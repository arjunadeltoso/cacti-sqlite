>				In Cacti, a graph template provides a skeleton for an actual graph. If you have many graphs that
				share most of their characteristics, using a graph template would probably make sense. After a
				graph is attached to a particular graph template, all changes made to the graph template will
				propagate out to all of its graphs, unless <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"

>					The first thing you must do is give the template a name. This name has nothing to do with
					the graph title, but is what you will use to identify the template throughout Cacti.
					Second, you will notice a list of graph field names with Use Per-Graph Value checkboxes
					next to each one. The nice thing about templates in Cacti is that you can choose whether
					to template each field on a per-field basis. If you leave the checkbox uncheked, every
					graph attached to the template will inherit its value from the template. If the checkbox
					is checked, every graph attached to the template will contain its own value for that
					particular field.

><P
>           By default the graph will be autoscaling so that it will adjust the y-axis to the range of the data.
           You can change this behaviour by explicitly setting the limits. The displayed y-axis will then range
           at least from lower-limit to upper-limit. Autoscaling will still permit those boundaries to be
           stretched unless the rigid option is set.&#13;</P
><P

><P
>           Sometimes the default algorithm for selecting the y-axis scale is not satisfactory. Normally the
           scale is selected from a predefined set of ranges and this fails miserably when you need to graph
           something like "260 + 0.001 * sin(x)". This option calculates the minimum and maximum y-axis from the
           actual minimum and maximum data values. Our example would display slightly less than "260-0.001" to
           slightly more than "260+0.001" (this feature was contributed by Sasha Mikheev).&#13;</P
><P
>           [-J|--alt-autoscale-min]</P
><P
>           Where "--alt-autoscale" will modify both the absolute maximum AND minimum values, this option will
           only affect the minimum value. The maximum value, if not defined on the command line, will be 0. This
           option can be useful when graphing router traffic when the WAN line uses compression, and thus the
           throughput may be higher than the WAN line speed.&#13;</P
