>			The real strength of Cacti is unleashed by using templates.
			There are three different types of templates with the basic Cacti installation:
			<B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Data Templates</B
>, <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Graph Templates</B
> and <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Host Templates</B
>.
			While it is perfectly fine to define all data sources and graphs without using
			Templates at all, the burden of this approach is high. In most installations,
			there are lots of devices of the same kind. And there are lots of data of the
			same kind, e.g. traffic information is needed for almost every device.
			Therefor, the parameters needed to create a traffic rrd file are defined
			by a <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Data Template</B
>, in this case known as "Interface - Traffic".
			These definitions are used by all Traffic-related rrd files.
		</P
><P
>			The same approach is used for defining <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Graph Templates</B
>.
			This is done only once. And all parameters defined within such a <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Graph Template</B
>
			are copied to all Graphs that are created using this Template.
		</P
><P
>			The last type of Templates are the <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Host Templates</B
>.
			They are not related to some rrdtool stuff. The purpose of <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Host Templates</B
>
			is to group all Graph Templates and Data Queries (these are explained later)
			for a given device type. So you will make up a <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Host Template</B
>
			e.g. for a specific type of router, switch, host and the like.
			By assigning the correct <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Host Template</B
> to each new Device,
			you'll never forget to create all needed Graphs.
		</P
><P
>There's no need to create all Templates on your own! Apart from the fact,
		that many common templates are provided out-of-the-box, there's a very simple
		machnism to <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Import Templates</SPAN
> and to <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Export Templates</SPAN
>.</P

>				In Cacti, a data template provides a skeleton for an actual data source. If you have many data
				sources that share most of their characteristics, using a data template would probably make sense.
				No change of a Data Template is propagated to already existing rrd files.
				But most of them may be changed by using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rrdtool tune</B
> from command line.
				Pay attention to not append new Data Source Items to already existing rrd files.
				There's no <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rrdtool</B
> command to achieve this!

					that you can choose whether to template each field on a per-field basis. If you leave the checkbox
					unchecked, every data source attached to the template will inherit its value from the template. If
					the checkbox is checked, every data source attached to the template will contain its own value for
					that particular field. When generating a real data source, you will be prompted to fill those
					non-templated fields.

														data source assumes that the counter never decreases, except when a counter overflows. It is always a whole INTEGER,
														floating point numbers are invalid.
														The update function takes the overflow into account.  The counter is stored as a per-second rate.
														When the counter overflows, <SPAN

                   										border and acts accordingly by adding an appropriate value to the result.

>GAUGE: numbers that are not continuously incrementing, e.g. a temperature reading.
